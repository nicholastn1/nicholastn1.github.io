I reduced unauthorized changes by ~70% through implementing lambda algorithms, decreased application response time by ~40% (from 24.3s to 14.8s) by optimizing N+1 queries and implementing Redis caching strategies. I also increased team productivity by ~20% through development pipeline restructuring."
